# The Fork

* The Fork is a made up resturaunt based in a town in south of Sweden. This app is a booking system designed so that visitors and staff easily can manage the booking of tables. Both parties can book, view, change and delete their reservations as per their own liking.

## Planning

* This project was developed through the Kanban board, you can find this via the github projects. Here the developer creates cards to help them during the development, this is mainly to make it easier to keep track of the different user stories and make sure everything is completed.

### Site goals

* This site is created with the intention to help the resturaunt keep track of their bookings. They should be able to view and change if they think it should be neccessary

* It should also be capable to provide the visitors with the same type of functions, the only exception should be that they only can manage their own bookings. The site will provide a simple way of making a reservation.
